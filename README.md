# Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP)

fMRI tasks used to explore emotion-motor interactions

Within this repository is code for an Active Escape task and an Approach-Avoidance task


  - In the Active Escape task, participants watch a countdown of numbers on the screen and are then prompted to make a motor response with the goal of potentially avoiding electrical stimulation (i.e., shocks).

   - In the Approach-Avoidance task, participants view emotional images and are instructed to use a joystick to simulate movement towards or away from the image. 

In these tasks, we manipulate emotional arousal to examine its effects on motor efficiency. This study is
