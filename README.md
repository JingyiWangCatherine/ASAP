# ASAP Active Escape Task
fMRI task used to explore emotion-motor interactions

### In this task, participants will view a countdown on the screen before making a quick motor response using a joystick. Depending on participants' performance, as well as the type of trial they completed, they may or may not receive a shock.

This is a 2(Controllability:Controllable/Unontrollable) x2(Shock Intensity:Perceptible/Unpleasant) design, such that there are four trial types in total:

  - Controllable, Perceptible:
      - participants can try to make a *successful* motor response to avoid a **perceptible** shock
      
  - Controllable, Unpleasant:
      - participants can try to make a *successful* motor response to avoid an **unpleasant** shock
      
  - Uncontrollable, Perceptible:
      - participants can try to make a motor response, but will receive a **perceptible** shock *regardless* of their performance

  - Uncontrollable, Unpleasant:
      - participants can try to make a motor response, but will receive an **unpleasant** shock *regardless* of their performance


The motor response involves the use of a joystick to move a center cursor, a small triangle, to a target circle which will be randomly placed in one of the four corners of the screen. Participants have 940ms to complete this motor response. A successful response is defined as any overlap of the cursor with the target circle. 

Following the motor response, participants will be responding to two questions about their emotional experience.
